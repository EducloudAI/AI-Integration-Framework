## 🎓 Education Program Built on the AI Integration Framework

Our education program is designed as a coherent learning ecosystem built entirely around the **AI Integration Framework**.  
Every course, lesson and practical exercise is structurally aligned with the framework’s layers, principles and Universal Questions.

Rather than teaching isolated tools or short-term techniques, the program focuses on **AI-native thinking**, **responsible application**, and **sustainable integration** of AI across different roles and domains.

All courses share a common foundation:
- a shared conceptual language  
- the same prompt and governance principles  
- consistent quality and oversight structures  
- a progression from understanding to application  

This ensures that participants from different backgrounds can collaborate effectively while developing domain-specific expertise.
