# Layer 0 — Core  
*Foundational structures for consistent AI behavior*

Layer 0 defines the essential building blocks that every prompt, workflow and AI interaction depends on.  
It ensures that all teams use the same structure, terminology and architectural foundation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To create a universal foundation for all AI usage by standardizing the prompt architecture, templates and naming conventions.

---

## 🧱 Responsibilities  
- Define the hierarchical prompt model  
- Provide structured prompt templates  
- Establish canonical naming conventions  
- Ensure consistency across all layers and activities  

---

## 📦 Outputs  
- Multi‑layered prompt architecture  
- Standardized prompt templates  
- Canonical naming system  

---

## ⚠️ Risks if ignored  
- Fragmented prompt structures  
- Inconsistent naming and metadata  
- Reduced quality and maintainability  
- Difficulty scaling across teams  

---

## 🔗 Relationship to other layers  
All other layers depend on Layer 0.  
Without a stable core, governance, testing, lifecycle and integration become inconsistent.
