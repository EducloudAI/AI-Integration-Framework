# 📘 Explore the 10‑Layer Architecture  
*A structured model for AI‑native operations*

The AI Integration Framework is built on a **universal 10‑layer architecture**, inspired by the clarity and modularity of the OSI model.  
Each layer represents a distinct domain of responsibility, ensuring that every AI initiative follows the same structure, language and quality standards.

This page provides a **compact overview** of all layers.  
Each layer links to a **dedicated deep‑dive page** with detailed explanations, responsibilities, risks, outputs and implementation guidance.
