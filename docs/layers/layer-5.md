# Layer 5 — Integration & Execution  
*Connecting AI systems to real workflows and infrastructure*

Layer 5 ensures that AI outputs can be deployed, executed and monitored in real operational environments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
To operationalize AI by defining how prompts and workflows integrate with systems, pipelines and monitoring tools.

---

## 🧱 Responsibilities  
- Define export/output formats  
- Provide CI/CD pipeline blueprints  
- Implement performance and cost monitoring  

---

## 📦 Outputs  
- Output format library  
- Deployment pipeline  
- Monitoring hooks  

---

## ⚠️ Risks if ignored  
- Deployment failures  
- Unmonitored costs  
- Performance degradation  
- Integration inconsistencies  

---

## 🔗 Relationship to other layers  
Depends on lifecycle (Layer 3) and feeds into value measurement (Layer 6).
