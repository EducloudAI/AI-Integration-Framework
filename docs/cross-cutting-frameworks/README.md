# 📘 Three Cross‑Cutting Frameworks  
*Perspectives that apply across every layer and component*

The AI Integration Framework is reinforced by **three cross‑cutting frameworks** that operate across all ten layers and all 35 activities.  
These perspectives ensure that AI adoption remains **controlled, measurable and human‑centered**, regardless of the domain, technology or maturity level of the organization.

## 🏛️ 1. Governance Framework  
*Connecting AI usage to measurable business outcomes*

The Governance Framework ensures that every AI initiative is aligned with organizational goals, compliance requirements and measurable value creation.

### 🎯 Purpose  
To connect AI usage directly to business outcomes, KPIs and ROI.

### 🧱 Responsibilities  
- Define decision‑making structures  
- Ensure accountability across roles  
- Align AI usage with KPIs and strategic goals  
- Provide oversight for risk, compliance and ethics  

### 📦 Outputs  
- Governance model  
- KPI alignment structure  
- Compliance and oversight mechanisms

## 📈 2. Maturity Framework  
*Defining organizational growth from Level 0 to Level 4*

The Maturity Framework describes how organizations evolve in their ability to adopt, govern and scale AI.  
It provides a clear roadmap from **initial experimentation** to **fully integrated, AI‑native operations**.

### 🎯 Purpose  
To measure and guide organizational progress across five maturity levels.

### 🧱 Responsibilities  
- Define maturity levels (0–4)  
- Provide criteria for assessment  
- Guide organizations toward higher capability  
- Support structured, predictable growth  

### 📦 Outputs  
- Maturity model  
- Assessment criteria  
- Growth roadmap

## 🧠 3. Competency Framework  
*Focusing on essential human skills for AI‑native work*

The Competency Framework ensures that AI adoption strengthens — rather than replaces — human capability.  
It highlights the skills required for effective collaboration between humans and AI systems.

### 🎯 Purpose  
To define the human skills required for safe, effective and creative AI usage.

### 🧱 Responsibilities  
- Identify essential competencies  
- Support training and development  
- Enable human‑AI collaboration  
- Promote analytical, creative and problem‑solving skills  

### 📦 Outputs  
- Competency model  
- Skill definitions  
- Training focus areas

## 🔗 Why These Frameworks Matter  
Together, these three perspectives ensure that AI adoption remains:

- **controlled** — through governance  
- **measurable** — through maturity  
- **human‑centered** — through competency  

They apply across **every layer**, **every activity** and **every component** of the AI Integration Framework.
