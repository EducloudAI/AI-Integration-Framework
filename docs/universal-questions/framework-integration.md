# 🔗 Integration Across the Framework  
**How universal questions connect the ten layers, maturity model and AI Native domains**

Universal questions are not an isolated feature.  
They are the connective tissue of the entire AI Integration Framework.  
They ensure that every component, every layer and every domain is approached with the same thinking structure.

This creates consistency, predictability and quality across the entire ecosystem.

# 🌟 A Thinking Structure That Works Everywhere  
Universal questions are used in:

- the ten layers  
- the maturity model  
- the scoring system  
- governance templates  
- AI Native Agile  
- AI Native TOGAF  
- AI Native Operations and Service Management  
- training and certification  
- the Prompt Framework  

The form of the output may change, but the thinking structure remains the same.

This is what makes the framework scalable and teachable.

# 🔹 Integration With the Ten Layers  
Each layer of the framework has its own purpose, but the same universal questions apply.  
This creates:

- consistent reasoning  
- predictable quality  
- shared understanding  
- cross functional alignment  

Examples:

- Layer 0 uses universal questions to define purpose and context  
- Layer 3 uses them to evaluate data and dependencies  
- Layer 7 uses them to assess governance and risk  
- Layer 9 uses them to measure value and impact  

The questions stay the same.  
The answers evolve with the layer.

# ⭐ Why This Integration Matters  
Because universal questions are used everywhere, they create:

- one shared language  
- one way of thinking  
- one approach to quality  
- one governance model  
- one learning experience  

This is what makes the AI Integration Framework coherent, scalable and future ready.
