**How Universal Questions Integrate Across the Framework**

Universal questions are not an isolated feature.
They are the connective tissue of the entire AI Integration Framework.
They ensure that every component, every layer and every domain is approached with the same thinking structure.

---

# 🔹 Integration With the Ten Layers  
Each layer of the framework has its own purpose, but the same universal questions apply.  
This creates:

- consistent reasoning  
- predictable quality  
- shared understanding  
- cross functional alignment  

Examples:

- Layer 0 uses universal questions to define purpose and context  
- Layer 3 uses them to evaluate data and dependencies  
- Layer 7 uses them to assess governance and risk  
- Layer 9 uses them to measure value and impact  

The questions do not change. The output may take different forms, but the thinking structure is always the same.

# ⭐ Why This Integration Matters  
Because universal questions are used everywhere, they create:

- one shared language  
- one way of thinking  
- one approach to quality  
- one governance model  
- one learning experience  

This is what makes the AI Integration Framework coherent, scalable and future ready.
