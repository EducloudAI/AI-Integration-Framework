# 🔹 Universal Questions That Activate Competencies  
**How structured, role‑agnostic questions unlock deeper thinking, collaboration and quality**

The AI Integration Framework uses a unique mechanism to ensure that every component, regardless of domain, maturity or role, is approached with clarity, critical thinking and a shared understanding.

This mechanism is based on **universal questions**:  
a set of structured, repeatable prompts that guide teams through quality, governance, risk, value and operational thinking.

These questions activate competencies across business, technical and management roles, making the framework accessible and powerful for everyone.

## 🌟 Why Universal Questions Matter

Most frameworks fail because they assume:

- everyone has the same level of expertise  
- teams know what to ask  
- governance is obvious  
- quality is intuitive  
- risks are visible  
- business value is clear  

In reality:

- teams overlook critical details  
- governance becomes inconsistent  
- quality varies per person  
- risks are discovered too late  
- business value is not aligned  

Universal questions solve this by giving **every team member the same thinking tools**, regardless of background.

## 🧠 What Universal Questions Achieve

Universal questions help teams:

- think more deeply  
- uncover hidden risks  
- clarify assumptions  
- improve quality  
- align business and technical perspectives  
- ensure governance is embedded  
- activate cross‑functional competencies  
- create consistent documentation  
- accelerate learning  

They turn every component into a **guided learning moment**.

## 📚 The Five Categories of Universal Questions

The framework uses five categories of universal questions that apply to every component:

---

### **1. Clarity Questions**  
Help define purpose, scope and expectations.

Examples:  
- What is the goal of this component?  
- Who is the intended user or stakeholder?  
- What outcome should this produce?  

---

### **2. Quality Questions**  
Ensure consistency, robustness and reliability.

Examples:  
- How do we know this is correct?  
- What tests or validations are needed?  
- What could cause inconsistent results?  

---

### **3. Governance & Risk Questions**  
Identify risks, controls and compliance needs.

Examples:  
- What risks are associated with this component?  
- Does this require human oversight?  
- Are there compliance or ethical considerations?  

---

### **4. Data & Context Questions**  
Ensure the right information is used.

Examples:  
- What data or context does this depend on?  
- Is the data fresh, accurate and authorized?  
- What happens if the context changes?  

---

### **5. Value & Impact Questions**  
Connect the component to business outcomes.

Examples:  
- How does this contribute to value creation?  
- What KPI does this influence?  
- How will we measure success?
