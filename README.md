## 🚀 The Problem: Scaling AI is Chaotic

Organizations are drowning in AI experiments. Today, only some applications include an AI agent, but this is rapidly becoming the standard. Applications such as Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini or custom models require prompts that quickly grow from dozens to hundreds and eventually thousands. This leads to critical and unanswered questions:

*   **Governance:** How do we ensure quality, security, and compliance?
*   **Management:** How do we version, test, and maintain prompts?
*   **Value:** What's the ROI? How does this align with our business goals?
*   **Responsibility:** Are we meeting ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements (like the EU AI Act)?

Without a structured approach, AI adoption remains fragmented, risky, and fails to deliver scalable value.

## 🎯 The Solution: A Structured 10-Layer Framework

The **AI Integration Framework** provides a practical, step-by-step blueprint to move from ad-hoc AI use to mature, organization-wide integration. It’s vendor-agnostic and designed for both technical and business stakeholders.

### **Core Philosophy: Build Control, Quality, and Value at Every Step**

The framework is built as 10 sequential layers. Each layer adds a new dimension of control, starting with basic standardization and evolving into full automation and strategic alignment.

#### **🔷 Visual Overview: The 10 Layers**
*(Hier zou je een professioneel diagram van de 10 lagen invoegen. Ik beschrijf het tekstueel.)*

*   **Layer 0: CORE** – Foundation: Prompt Framework & Standards.
*   **Layer 1: METADATA & GOVERNANCE** – Traceability & Roles.
*   **Layer 2: QUALITY & TESTING** – Reliability & Safety.
*   **Layer 3: LIFECYCLE & MAINTENANCE** – Versioning & Feedback.
*   **Layer 4: DATA & CONTEXT GOVERNANCE** – Data Lineage & Freshness.
*   **Layer 5: INTEGRATION & EXECUTION** – CI/CD & Monitoring.
*   **Layer 6: VALUE & BUSINESS ALIGNMENT** – KPI & ROI Linkage.
*   **Layer 7: SECURITY & DISASTER RECOVERY** – Incident Response.
*   **Layer 8: ADOPTION & KNOWLEDGE** – Training & Best Practices.
*   **Layer 9: ECOSYSTEM & EXTENSIBILITY** – APIs & Community.

### **📈 The AI Maturity Model: Your Roadmap**

The framework is directly linked to a clear maturity model, guiding your journey:
*   **Level 0 → 1:** From Chaos to Standards (Layer 0)
*   **Level 1 → 2:** From Standards to Governance (Layers 1, 3)
*   **Level 2 → 3:** From Governance to Automation (Layers 2, 4, 5)
*   **Level 3 → 4:** From Automation to Strategic Innovation (Layers 6, 7, 8, 9)

## ⚡ Getting Started in 5 Minutes

1.  **Understand the Core:** Start with **[Layer 0: The Prompt Framework](docs/layer-0-core/)**. This is the foundational tool for creating clear, reusable AI instructions.
2.  **Assess Your Current State:** Use the **[AI Maturity Model Self-Assessment](docs/maturity-model/)** to identify your starting point and next steps.
3.  **Implement Your First Layer:** Based on your assessment, pick the relevant template (e.g., Metadata Schema, Test Checklist) from the `/templates` folder and adapt it to a pilot project.
4.  **Join the Community:** Have questions or want to share your use case? Open an [Issue](https://github.com/EducloudAI/AI-Integration-Framework/issues) or start a [Discussion](https://github.com/EducloudAI/AI-Integration-Framework/discussions).
